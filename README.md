Gameplay3D2D

A project example that uses the Gameplay3D engine for 2D based rendering.
The code includes a viewport setup with a fixed aspect option,
to render with a letterbox/pillarbox if necessary on any resolution.
A custom projection matrix is also used to keep sprite coordinates
independent from the screen resolution.  The example 3D cube is included
to show how 3D can be combined in the same viewport.  An example of an animated
sprite class is also included.

To compile the code it is best to start a new project for your specific platform.
